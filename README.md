# Resonant Intelligence Lab

**Resonance as substrate. Intelligence as layer.**

Open research exploring precision therapeutics through physics-validated frequency protocols.

## Current Focus
Therapeutic audio for neurological health, chronic pain, and sleep disorders.

## Approach
- **Physics-first:** Cymatics and resonance as the foundation
- **Clinically validated:** Measurable outcomes, reproducible protocols  
- **Open-source:** All research, protocols, and code published transparently
- **Collaborative:** Inviting researchers, clinicians, and practitioners to contribute

## Active Research
Coming soon: Initial frequency protocols and validation methodology

## Philosophy
When AI hype collapses, physics remains. We're building on vibrational substrate, 
using intelligence as the scaling layerâ€”not the story.
