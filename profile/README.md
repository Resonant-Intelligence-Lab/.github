# Resona: Therapeutic Audio Research

## Exploring Precision Bio-Frequency Protocols
Open-source research investigating the therapeutic effects of sound and vibration through validated frequency protocols. Designed for **collaboration, experimentation, and discovery**.

---

## Status
🚧 Early-stage research. Protocols under development. **Not medical advice.**

---

## Research Questions
- Which specific frequencies produce measurable physiological or cognitive effects?
- How do individual variables (age, condition, genetics) influence response?
- What delivery methods (headphones, transducers, environmental systems) optimize outcomes?
- Can visual cymatics enhance biofeedback and deepen engagement?

---

## Methodology
1. **Literature Review** — Survey of existing research in frequency medicine, neuroacoustics, and cymatics  
2. **Protocol Design** — Development of specific frequency sets, durations, and delivery methods  
3. **Self-Experimentation** — N=1 trials with rigorous logging and analysis  
4. **Community Validation** — Open protocols for contributors to test and report results  
5. **Future Clinical Collaboration** — Partnerships for formal studies under medical oversight  

---

## Current Protocols
*Coming soon: Initial protocols targeting sleep improvement, focus enhancement, and pain reduction.*

---

## How to Contribute
- Test protocols and share structured, measurable results  
- Suggest frequency ranges or modulation strategies  
- Contribute analysis tools, scripts, or visualizations  
- Share relevant academic papers or datasets

## Disclaimer
This research is exploratory and **not a substitute for professional medical advice or treatment**. Consult healthcare providers for medical conditions. Shared protocols are strictly for experimental and research purposes.
