## Hi there 👋

# Therapeutic Audio Protocols

Open research exploring precision therapeutics through validated frequency protocols.

## Status
🚧 Early-stage research. Protocols in development. Not medical advice.

## Research Questions
- Which specific frequencies produce measurable therapeutic outcomes?
- How do individual differences (age, condition, genetics) affect response?
- What delivery mechanisms (headphones, transducers, environmental) are most effective?
- Can cymatics visualization enhance biofeedback loops?

## Methodology
1. **Literature review:** Existing research on frequency medicine, cymatics, neuroacoustics
2. **Protocol design:** Specific frequencies, durations, delivery methods
3. **Self-experimentation:** N=1 trials with rigorous measurement
4. **Community validation:** Open protocols for others to test and report
5. **Clinical partnerships:** Formal studies with medical oversight (future)

## Current Protocols
*Coming soon: Initial protocols for sleep quality, pain reduction, focus enhancement*

## How to Contribute
- Test protocols and share structured results
- Suggest frequency ranges based on research
- Contribute measurement tools or analysis code
- Share relevant academic papers or clinical data

## Disclaimer
This is exploratory research, not medical treatment. Always consult healthcare 
providers for medical conditions. Protocols shared for research purposes only.
